### The main idea of the project is to track all products (primarily food products) and obtain certain statistics

## Planned features
* Parsing receipts from different supermarkets in Ukraine (Firstly from Silpo and ATB)
* Offline storage (with iCloud sync)
* Online storage (might be Firebase)
* and more

## Goals
* Create project from scratch (From design to publishing and support)
* Get practical experience using:
  - PointFree's [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), [swift-parsing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing) and [Dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)
  - Apple's [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) framework
